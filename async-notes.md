Reading the [ async book ](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/01_getting_started/02_why_async.html)

```rust

async fn get_two_sites_async() {
    // Create two different "futures" which, when run to completion,
    // will asynchronously download the webpages.
    let future_one = download_async("https://www.foo.com");
    let future_two = download_async("https://www.bar.com");

    // Run both futures to completion at the same time.
    join!(future_one, future_two);
}
```
